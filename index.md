I am a post-doctoral research scientist at Columbia University, collaborating with [Chaolin Zhang](https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu/faculty/chaolin-zhang) and other wonderful members in the [Zhang Lab](https://zhanglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/). Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in computer science at Washington University in St. Louis under the mentorship of [Gary Stormo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Stormo). My current research focuses on developing computational methods for analyzing protein-DNA/RNA interactions.

A central theme in my research is to consider what representation is suited for DNA sequences that give the most helpful information. Traditionally, there are k-mers, position-weight-matrices, parametric statistical models like HMMs, and, more recently, deep neural networks. I am particularly interested in sparse representations, a rich framework that allows us to build techniques to answer challenging inferential questions in regulatory genomics.

For example, in regulatory genomics, we want to infer the following:

- The DNA sequences' regulatory elements, e.g., the motifs.
- The key regulatory elements in the DNA sequences give rise to the observed phenomenon.
- The counterfactuals, e.g., a minimal change to a DNA sequence that turns off the observed effects.

We can obtain a sparse representation of DNA sequences using principled deep learning techniques, e.g., deep unfolding. We use [sparse representations to reveal many more hidden motifs not shown on the JASPAR database](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad378/7192989?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=bioinformatics&utm_medium=email). Our result shows that sparse representation is a scalable and interpretable approach to biological sequence problems.

My name in Mandarin is Kuei-Hsien Chu (朱桂賢). Hsien pronounced like Shane, and that's how I got Shane. I grew up in Taiwan and have been living in the US since 2008.
